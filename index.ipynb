For example, with months on one axis and years on another, they can be a great way to see both seasonality and year on year trends\n", "* A time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties such as mean and variance remain constant over time\n", "* Most time series models work on the assumption that the time series are stationary (assumption of homoscedasticity)\n", "* Many time series datasets *do* have trends, violating the assumption of homoscedasticity\n", "* Common examples are trends that include linear (straight line over time), exponential, and periodic. Some datasets also have increasing (or decreasing) variance over time\n", "* Any given dataset may exhibit multiple trends (e.g. linear, periodic, and reduction of variance)\n", "* Rolling statistics can be used to test for trends to see whether the centrality and/or dispersion of time series changes over time\n", "* The Dickey-Fuller test is a common test for determining whether a time series contains trends\n", "* Common approaches for removing trends and seasonality include taking a log-transform, subtracting the rolling mean, and differencing\n", "* Decomposing allows you to separately view *seasonality* (which could be daily, weekly, annual, etc), *trend*, and *random*, which is the variability in time series after removing the effects of the seasonality and trend \n"]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.7.3"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
